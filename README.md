Simple point and click game with a little bit of story and a lot of unfunny jokes. It's much funnier in Polish tho.

I only did the programming part and the graphics were made by my friend Kacper Wojas - [profil GitHub](https://github.com/Cre4tos)

you can download playable version on [this website](https://cre4tos.itch.io/flashlight-game)

Note, that if you are a hiring manager and want to assess the game, you are advised to skip the whole intro (all the black screens with text).
